# WaveVolume

## Hand Gesture Volume Control using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

WaveVolume is a computer vision project that lets users control their system’s audio volume using simple hand gestures captured through a webcam. The program detects the thumb and index finger distance in real time and adjusts the system volume accordingly — hands-free control through motion!
