# WaveVolume

## Hand Gesture Volume Control using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

WaveVolume is a computer vision project that lets users control their system’s audio volume using simple hand gestures captured through a webcam. The program detects the thumb and index finger distance in real time and adjusts the system volume accordingly — hands-free control through motion!

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+**
- **OpenCV** – image processing and webcam input
- **MediaPipe** – real-time hand landmark detection (powered by TensorFlow Lite)
- **TensorFlow Lite** – backend model inference engine
- **PyAutoGUI** – system volume control automation
